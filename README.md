# Hi there im Cleopatra 👋
> You can also call me Cleo 😉

### I'm a NodeJS / SwiftUI dev with a passion for coding and taking on more projects then they can handle. ❤️

### Many of the projects I work on don't make their way over to GitHub, so I suppose you could say this is the collection of the best of the best.
> Or just the ones I arbitrarily decided to upload. 😮‍💨
